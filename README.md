👋 **Hello! My name is Kevin**, and I am a Computer Science student currently in the internship phase, focusing on Android development. While my skills are still growing, I am committed to learning and improving with each project I take on.

My projects are a work in progress, and I’m continuously updating them as I learn more about **Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and Android development**. Although I'm still figuring out how to best implement **Material Design principles**, I’m eager to explore and apply the knowledge I gain from the Android community.

<i>**Ps:** This portfolio is a snapshot of my journey so far. I’m dedicated to enhancing my skills and contributing to exciting and innovative projects in the future.</i>
